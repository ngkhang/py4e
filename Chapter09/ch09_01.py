Exercise 1:
    Download a copy of the file www.py4e.com/code3/words.txt

    Write a program that reads the words in words.txt and stores\
        them as keys in a dictionary. It doesnâ€™t matter what the
        values are. Then you can use the in operator as a fast way
        to check whether a string is in the dictionary.
